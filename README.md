### PROBLEMS FACED DURING ASSINGMNET

First of all we was not familiar with Kaggle, so all of us registered our self in kaggle. Then in joining competition we were facing issue
in phone number verification. Every time Kaggle was showing that this number can not be verify. So we send complain to kaggle help and support.
